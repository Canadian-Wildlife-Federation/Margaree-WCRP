# Project Overview {.unnumbered}


## Purpose {.unnumbered}

The purpose of the Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) is to systematically identify and assess potential barriers to Atlantic salmon migration in the Margaree Watershed. By conducting both desktop and field assessments, the project aims to evaluate the extent of migration barriers caused by manmade structures and identify opportunities for increasing connectivity for salmonid species. This assessment will guide the prioritization of barriers for remediation, ensuring that the most impactful sites are addressed first to enhance Atlantic salmon habitat and improve migration conditions.

## Barrier Count {.unnumbered}

In the Margaree River Watershed, # structures potentially disconnect Atlantic Salmon habitat. Of these, # have been confirmed as barriers with habitat upstream and # require further field assessment.

## Current Connectivity Status {.unnumbered}

In the Margaree River watershed, # structures potentially disconnect Atlantic Salmon habitat. Of these, # are identified as barriers in need of rehabilitation (priority barriers), # barriers that do not warrant rehabilitation (non-actionable), and # require further field assessment.

## Progress Summary {.unnumbered}

The planning process for the Margaree River Connectivity Rehabilitation Plan began in 2024. Since that time, # structures have been assessed to determine their fish passage status, and # habitat confirmations have been completed. In total, 3 barriers have been rehabilitated through the removal of debris jams, resulting in improved or restored access to # km of habitat for focal species.
