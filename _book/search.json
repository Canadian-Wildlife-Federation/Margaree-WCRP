    "text": "Purpose\nThe purpose of the Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) is to systematically identify and assess potential barriers to Atlantic salmon migration in the Margaree Watershed. By conducting both desktop and field assessments, the project aims to evaluate the extent of migration barriers caused by manmade structures and identify opportunities for increasing connectivity for salmonid species. This assessment will guide the prioritization of barriers for remediation, ensuring that the most impactful sites are addressed first to enhance Atlantic salmon habitat and improve migration conditions.",

    "text": "Purpose\nThe following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents …\nWCRPs are long-term, actionable plans that blend local stakeholder and rightsholder knowledge with innovative geographical information systems (GIS) analyses to gain a shared understanding of where restoration efforts will have the greatest benefit for migratory fish. The planning process is inspired by the Conservation Standards (v.4.0), which is a conservation planning framework that allows planning teams to systematically identify, implement, and monitor strategies to apply the most effective solutions to high priority conservation problems. There is a rich history of fish and fish habitat conservation and restoration work in the Lower Nicola River watershed that this WCRP builds upon and aims to complement over the length of the plan. This includes work undertaken by the Scw’exmx Tribal Council and the four member or affiliate nations (Coldwater, Upper Nicola, Shackan and Nooaitch bands), the Lower Nicola Indian Band, the Nicola Watershed Governance Project including the Salmon Ecosystem Table and Nicola Restoration Committee, the Nicola Basin Collaborative, and the Risk Assessment Methodology for Salmon (RAMS). The planning team will aim to work with the Nicola Watershed Governance Project and the Nicola Basin Collaborative to promote coordination, decision-making, and implementation related to this plan.\nThe planning team compiled existing structure location and assessment data, habitat data, and previously identified priorities in the watershed, and combined this with local and Indigenous knowledge to create a strategic watershed-scale plan to improve freshwater connectivity. The Lower Nicola River WCRP planning team applied the WCRP planning framework to define the “thematic” scope of freshwater connectivity and refine the “geographic” scope to identify the portions of the watershed where connectivity restoration efforts will take place. Additionally, the team selected focal species, assessed the current key habitat connectivity status of the watershed, defined concrete goals for gains in connectivity, sundertook an iterative structure-ranking process to identify a list of priority barriers for rehabilitation to achieve those goals (see ?tbl-confirmed). Although the current version of this plan is based on the best-available information at the time of publishing, WCRPs are intended to be “living plans” that are updated regularly as new information becomes available, or if local priorities and contexts change. As such, this document should be interpreted as a current “snapshot” in time, and future iterations of this WCRP will build upon the results presented in this plan to continuously improve the practice of aquatic barrier rehabilitation for migratory fishes in the Lower Nicola River watershed. For more information on how WCRPs are developed, see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021)."

Naturally accessible waterbodies were spatially delineated for each species using stream characteristics that define the upper limit of their movement based on their swimming abilities (Table 1.1). The spatial extent of the naturally accessible waterbodies layer was then refined based on existing fish observation data and/or redd surveys (for Atlantic salmon). These maps were explored by the planning team to incorporate additional local knowledge, ensure accuracy, and finalize the criteria used to define naturally accessible waterbodies, which are shown for Atlantic salmon ({numref}fig2). The new geographic scope formed the foundation for all subsequent analyses and planning steps, including mapping and modelling key habitat, quantifying the current connectivity status, goal setting, and action planning Mazany-Wright et al.

    "text": "Target species\nTarget species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being conserved and/or restored in the watershed. The selection of these target species was driven primarily by the targets species of the primary fund supporting this planning work.\n\nAtlantic Salmon\nAtlantic salmon are anadromous fishes, meaning mature adults spawn in freshwater and juveniles rear in freshwater before undergoing a process called smoltification where they migrate out to the ocean for 1-3+ years before returning to the freshwater to repeat this process. Due to this migratory process, salmon require unimpeded access between the ocean and freshwater habitats to complete their life cycle.\nAtlantic salmon spawn in the pool-riffle transition zones of the main stem and larger tributaries of a river {cite}deGaudemar2000; Finstad2010. Within these stretches, they seek out the tails of pools, where substrate size allows for females to excavate a space to deposit the eggs to incubate below gravel beds. Fast flowing, well oxygenated water with minimal fine sediments helps to maximize successful embryo development. Atlantic salmon juveniles (fry and parr) rear in habitat that is deeper and slower, to facilitate their weaker swimming and predation capabilities. Water depth, velocity, and substrate size tend to increase with parr as they increase in size and age. Shelter, in the form of large rocks, boulders, or overhead cover provide crucial refuge for overwintering habitat. Channel gradients most typically associated with these preferred spawning and rearing habitats range from 0.12 to 25%; with highest concentrations below 3% {cite}Amiro1993.\n\n\nAmerican Eel\nAmerican eel are catadromous species, meaning they spawn in the Sargasso Sea and drift with the ocean currents towards the continental shelf as glass eels. Elvers then continue migrating towards freshwater tributaries to feed and mature, although some populations have been known to stay in the estuaries and bays or move between freshwater and estuary habitat over their life cycle. Their ability to tolerate a wide variety of salinities and temperature thresholds allows them to occupy a variety of habitat types. See Appendix B for maps of modelled eel habitat in the seven northeastern watersheds.",

To support a flexible prioritization framework to identify priority barriers in the watershed, two assumptions are made: 1,any modelled (i.e., passability status is unknown) or partial barriers are treated as complete barriers to passage and 2, the habitat modelling is binary, it does not assign any habitat quality values.

The habitat model uses two geomorphic characteristics of the stream network — channel gradient and mean annual discharge — to identify potential spawning habitat and rearing habitat for each target species. The habitat model does not attempt to definitively map each habitat type nor estimate habitat quality, but rather identifies stream segments that have high potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for each species based on the geomorphic characteristics of the segment. For more details on the connectivity and habitat model structure and parameters, please see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021).

    "text": "Purpose\nThe following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a collaborative planning effort, for the Margaree watershed, the overall aim of which is to build collaborative partnerships focusing on the health of the Margaree watershed to reduce the threat of aquatic barriers to migratory fish and the livelihoods that they support. This plan was developed to identify priority strategies that the Margaree River WCRP planning team (see Table 1) proposes to undertake between 2024-2035 to conserve and restore fish passage in the watershed, through crossing rehabilitation and barrier prevention strategies.\nWCRPs are long-term, actionable plans that blend local stakeholder and rightsholder knowledge with innovative geographical information systems (GIS) analyses to gain a shared understanding of where restoration efforts will have the greatest benefit for migratory fish. The planning process is inspired by the Conservation Standards (v.4.0), which is a conservation planning framework that allows planning teams to systematically identify, implement, and monitor strategies to apply the most effective solutions to high priority conservation problems. There is a rich history of fish and fish habitat conservation and restoration work in the Margaree watershed that this WCRP builds upon and aims to complement over the length of the plan. This includes work undertaken by the Margaree Salmon Association and work supported by the Nova Scotia Salmon Association (NSSA) and the Atlantic Salmon Federation (ASF). The planning team will aim to work with the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and other local stakeholders to promote coordination, decision-making, and implementation related to this plan.\nThe planning team compiled existing structure location and assessment data, habitat data, and previously identified priorities in the watershed, and combined this with local knowledge to create a strategic watershed-scale plan to improve freshwater connectivity. The Margaree River WCRP planning team applied the WCRP planning framework to define the “thematic” scope of freshwater connectivity and refine the “geographic” scope to identify the portions of the watershed where connectivity restoration efforts will take place. Additionally, the team selected focal species, assessed the current key habitat connectivity status of the watershed, defined concrete goals for gains in connectivity, undertook an iterative structure-ranking process to identify a list of priority barriers for rehabilitation to achieve those goals (see Table 2.1). Although the current version of this plan is based on the best-available information at the time of publishing, WCRPs are intended to be “living plans” that are updated regularly as new information becomes available, or if local priorities and contexts change. As such, this document should be interpreted as a current “snapshot” in time, and future iterations of this WCRP will build upon the results presented in this plan to continuously improve the practice of aquatic barrier rehabilitation for migratory fishes in the Margaree watershed. For more information on how WCRPs are developed, see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021b).",

    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment\n(see Table 1).\nThe current connectivity status assessment relies on GIS analyses to map known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identify stream reaches that have potential spawning and rearing habitat, estimate the proportion of habitat that is currently accessible to target species, and prioritize barriers for field assessment that would provide the greatest gains in connectivity. To support a flexible prioritization framework to identify priority barriers in the watershed, two assumptions are made: 1,any modelled (i.e., passability status is unknown) or partial barriers are treated as complete barriers to passage and 2, the habitat modelling is binary, it does not assign any habitat quality values. As such, the current connectivity status will be refined over time as more data on habitat and barriers are collected.

Barriers that have been modelled (i.e., points where streams and road/rail networks intersect) are assumed to be barriers until field verification is undertaken and structures that have been assessed as “potential” barriers (e.g., may be passable at certain flow levels or for certain life history stages) require further investigation before a definitive remediation decision is made. Additionally, the habitat model identifies stream segments that have the potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for target species but does not attempt to quantify habitat quality or suitability (see Appendix B), which will require additional field verification once barrier assessments have completed.Data deficient structures represents structures that are a priority to evaluate further through barrier assessment and habitat confirmations because some structures will likely be passable, others will not be associated with usable habitat, and others may not be feasible to remediate because of logistic considerations (Table 3). Some barriers were moved forward to the “priority barrier list” (see Table 2) and others were eliminated from consideration due to one or more of the considerations discussed above (see Table 4). The priority barrier list represents structures that were confirmed to be partial or full barriers to fish passage and that block access to confirmed habitat. Barriers on the priority list were reviewed by planning team members and selected for inclusion for proactive pursual of remediation.

    "text": "Connectivity Modelling\nThe current connectivity status was estimated using three models:\nAccessibility model: Naturally accessible waterbodies are those that are considered likely accessible to focal species if no human-made barriers existed on the landscape. These were spatially delineated for each focal species using natural barriers (i.e., waterfalls, gradient barriers, or subsurface flows) that would limit upstream movement ({numref}Table1).\nHabitat model: A subset of the naturally accessible waterbody layer was defined as key habitat based on the KEA. The habitat model identifies waterbodies that have a higher potential to support key habitat based on stream characteristics like channel gradient and discharge. The habitat model criteria can be found in ({numref}Table 1).\nConnectivity model: A layer of known or modelled structures was overlaid on the key habitat results. Structures with unknown passability were treated as a full barrier until confirmed passable (100% passable) or partially passable (25, 50, or 75%) by either local knowledge, desktop review, or field assessment. Watershed connectivity was estimated by calculating the amount of key habitat that is connected to the ocean (i.e., not fragmented by human-made barriers). The amount of key habitat considered connected was determined by the cumulative passability of all downstream barriers. Key habitat with only passable structures downstream was considered fully connected. All key habitat with any full barrier downstream was considered disconnected. Connected key habitat upstream of partial barriers was weighted based on the passability values of any downstream partial barriers. For example, a 10 km habitat patch with two downstream partial barriers (both with 50% passability) was considered to represent 2.5 km of connected key habitat. All connected habitats were summed and divided by the total amount of key habitat in the watershed to determine the proportion of connected habitat relative to the entire watershed.\nA primary outcome of the WCRP is addressing barriers to restore connectivity within the Margaree River watershed. To achieve the goals set out in this plan it is necessary to identify a series of barriers that if made passable would reconnect a large contribution of Atlantic salmon and American eel habitat.\nAfter all existing data and knowledge are collated for known and modelled crossings, an iterative ranking process is conducted to help confirm barriers to target for rehabilitation to meet the goals. The ranking process is primarily used to guide field assessments and maximize efficiency in ground truthing data/knowledge inputs and model outputs, while providing a secondary purpose to evaluate the relative key habitat gains of confirmed barriers in the watershed. Field assessments can include an assessment of either the passability status of a structure (whether fish can pass upstream, and to what degree), whether the upstream habitat is suitable for the focal species, and whether there are other undocumented anthropogenic or natural barriers upstream or downstream. First, structures are grouped into ‘sets’. Sets are identified by maximizing the key habitat gain for barriers in the same tributary system. If adding a structure to a set reduces the gain-per-barrier (i.e., the total habitat gain of the set divided by the number of barriers in the set), then it is excluded and will be considered part of another set. Each set is ranked by its potential to contribute to restoring the overall habitat connectivity. The higher a set is ranked, the more potential contribution it makes to restoring the overall habitat connectivity, therefore making the set a higher priority for field assessment. By assessing the passability status and upstream habitat of the top-ranked sets, we close knowledge gaps with the greatest influence on the overall connectivity model results.\nSets are ranked by a combination of two factors:\nAn overall ranking for each set was produced as a composite of the long-term and immediate potential gain ranks to prioritize sets that maximize long-term and immediate potential to improve key habitat connectivity in the watershed. All structures in the watershed (excluding those confirmed as passable) were ranked and a subset of those structures were selected for field assessment.",

    "text": "Focal Species\nFocal species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being conserved or restored in the watershed. In the Margaree watershed, the planning team selected Atlantic salmon as a primary focus with interest in incorporating American eel in future work. The selection of these focal species was driven primarily by the focal species of the primary funds supporting this planning work, the rich angling history of the Margaree, and the current threats to Atlantic salmon in the region.\n\nAtlantic Salmon\nAtlantic salmon are anadromous fishes, meaning mature adults spawn in freshwater and juveniles rear in freshwater before undergoing a process called smoltification where they migrate out to the ocean for 1-3+ years before returning to the freshwater to repeat this process. Due to this migratory process, salmon require unimpeded access between the ocean and freshwater habitats to complete their life cycle.\nAtlantic salmon spawn in the pool-riffle transition zones of the main stem and larger tributaries of a river {cite}deGaudemar2000; Finstad2010. Within these stretches, they seek out the tails of pools, where substrate size allows for females to excavate a space to deposit the eggs to incubate below gravel beds. Fast flowing, well oxygenated water with minimal fine sediments helps to maximize successful embryo development. Atlantic salmon juveniles (fry and parr) rear in habitat that is deeper and slower, to facilitate their weaker swimming and predation capabilities. Water depth, velocity, and substrate size tend to increase with parr as they increase in size and age. Shelter, in the form of large rocks, boulders, or overhead cover provide crucial refuge for overwintering habitat. Channel gradients most typically associated with these preferred spawning and rearing habitats range from 0.12 to 25%; with highest concentrations below 3% {cite}Amiro1993.\n\n\nAmerican Eel\nAmerican eel are catadromous species, meaning they spawn in the Sargasso Sea and drift with the ocean currents towards the continental shelf as glass eels. Elvers then continue migrating towards freshwater tributaries to feed and mature, although some populations have been known to stay in the estuaries and bays or move between freshwater and estuary habitat over their life cycle. Their ability to tolerate a wide variety of salinities and temperature thresholds allows them to occupy a variety of habitat types. See Appendix B for maps of modelled eel habitat in the seven northeastern watersheds.",

This was measured by calculating and ranking sets by the amount of total upstream key habitat (i.e., ignoring any additional upstream sets). This ranking identifies sets that would have the greatest long-term potential gain in habitat connectivity once any subsequent upstream barriers are addressed.\nThe immediate potential impact that restoring connectivity at that structure could have on the overall connectivity status. This was measured by calculating the amount of functional upstream habitat (i.e., key habitat between that set and the next upstream set of structures). Sets were then ranked by functional upstream habitat amount in tiers, where sets with no downstream sets were ranked first, then sets with one downstream set, and so on. This ranking identifies sets that have the greatest immediate potential gain in habitat by prioritizing sets that don’t rely on rehabilitation of downstream or upstream sets to realize these gains.\n\n\n\nAssessments\nThe majority of crossing structures in the Margaree River watershed were stream crossings for roads and trails making them the most abundant structure type in the watershed. The Margaree River watershed is also home to heavy beaver activity which can impact the flow and behaviour of streams within the watershed. Rapid assessment and ground truthing was completed for many of the structures within the watershed with formal assessments completed at three sites. Subsequent planning was done in partnership with the Nova Scotia Salmon Association to start the process of restoring structures by applying for applicable permits and beginning the restoration planning process.",

The habitat model uses two geomorphic characteristics of the stream network — channel gradient and mean annual discharge — to identify potential spawning habitat and rearing habitat for each target species. The habitat model does not attempt to definitively map each habitat type nor estimate habitat quality, but rather identifies stream segments that have high potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for each species based on the geomorphic characteristics of the segment.

Available local knowledge and data were incorporated and overrule habitat model results. Thick light-blue lines represent habitat that is currently connected, whereas thick red lines represent habitat considered to be disconnected because it is upstream of confirmed barriers or data-deficient structures. The y-axis represents the amount of habitat (km) blocked by each structure, discounted by 50% for first-order streams, and by passability (25%, 50%, 0r 75%) of partial barriers. Barriers that were rehabilitated through implementation of this plan are shown, but other excluded structures (e.g., those found to be passable) are not.",

Structures are ranked based on how much (km) habitat is upstream to the next structure or set of structures and that would be reconnected if the structure(s) became passable. Habitat upstream of data-deficient structures is considered disconnected until field assessments are completed. Structures that were excluded as passable are not shown; however, rehabilitated barriers are shown to demonstrate the connectivity gains achieved through implementation of this plan.",
