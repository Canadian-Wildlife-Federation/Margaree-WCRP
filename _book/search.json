    "text": "Current Connectivity Status\nThe current connectivity status assessment relies on GIS analyses to map known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identify stream reaches that have potential spawning and rearing habitat, estimate the proportion of habitat that is currently accessible to target species, and prioritize barriers for field assessment that would provide the greatest gains in connectivity. To support a flexible prioritization framework to identify priority barriers in the watershed, two assumptions are made: 1,any modelled (i.e., passability status is unknown) or partial barriers are treated as complete barriers to passage and 2, the habitat modelling is binary, it does not assign any habitat quality values. As such, the current connectivity status will be refined over time as more data on habitat and barriers are collected. For more detail on how the connectivity status assessments were conducted, see Data Download and Methods.\nTable 4.1: Table showing current connectivity status for the Margaree watershed and the percentage of connected versus disconnected key habitat within the watershed as of February 27th, 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Species\nKEA\nIndicator\nPoor\nFair\nGood\nVery Good\n\n\n\n\nAtlantic Salmon\n% of Key Habitat\n% of total habitat\n&lt;50%\n51-75%\n76-90%\n&gt;90%\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Status:\n\n\n\n91\nComments: Indicator rating definitions are based on the consensus decisions of the planning team, including the decision not to define Fair. The current status is based on the connectivity model output, which is current as of February 5th, 2026.\nRanking of structures helps to identify which structures would open up the most habitat in key habitat areas of the watershed, this acts as a planning tool to indicate which barriers make sense to focus on in order to have the most impact on connectivity for focal species in the watershed.\nTable 4.2: Goals to improve (1) spawning, and (2) rearing habitat connectivity for focal species in the Margaree watershed over the lifespan of the WCRP (2024-2035). The goals were established through discussions with the planning team and represent the resulting desired state of connectivity in the watershed. The goals are subject to change as more information and data are collected over the course of the plan timeline (e.g., the current connectivity status is updated based on barrier field assessments).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal #\nGoal\n\n\n\n\n1\nBy 2035, increase the amount of connected habitat within the Margaree watershed.",

    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment Methods\nThe connectivity status assessment for anadromous salmonids in the Margaree watershed builds on existing connectivity modelling work undertaken by the Canadian Wildlife Federation in partnership with the Atlantic Salmon Federation. The Margaree model within the NovaScotiaFishPass spatially locates known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identifies potential spawning and rearing habitat for focal species, and estimates the amount of habitat that is currently accessible to focal species within the Margaree. The model uses an adapted version of the Intrinsic Potential (IP) fish habitat modelling framework (see Sheer et al. (2009) for an overview of the IP framework). The habitat model uses two geomorphic characteristics of the stream network — channel gradient and mean annual discharge — to identify potential spawning habitat and rearing habitat for each focal species. The habitat model does not attempt to definitively map each habitat type nor estimate habitat quality, but rather identifies stream segments that have high potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for each species based on the geomorphic characteristics of the segment. For more details on the connectivity and habitat model structure and parameters, please see Mazany-Wright, N and Norris, S. M. and Lapointe, N. W. R. and Rebellato, B. (2021a). The variables and thresholds used to model potential spawning and rearing habitat for each focal species are summarized in Table 1. The quantity of modelled habitat for each species was aggregated for each habitat type and represents a linear measure of potential habitat.\nTable 1: Parameters and thresholds used to inform the Intrinsic Potential habitat model for spawning and rearing habitat for each focal species in the Margaree River watershed.\n\n\nSpeciesChannel Gradient (%)Mean annual discharge (m3/s)Channel gradient (%)Mean Annual discharge (m3/s)Minimum Lake area (ha)Multiplier (1.5x)Chinook Salmon0-30.46-322.50-50.28-100(Busch et al. 2011, Cooney and Holzer 2006)(Bjornn and Reiser 1991, Neuman and Newcombe 1977, Woll et al. 2017, Roberge et al. 2002, Raleigh and Miller 1986)(Woll et al. 2017, Porter et al. 2008)(Agrawal et al. 2005)Coho Salmon0-50.164-59.150-50.03-40Wetland(Roberge et al. 2002, Sloat et al. 2017)(Bjornn and Reiser 1991, Sloat et al. 2017, Neuman and Newcombe 1977, Woll et al. 2017, McMahon 1983)(Porter et al. 2008, Rosenfeld et al. 2000)(Agrawal et al. 2005, Burnett et al. 2007)Sockeye Salmon0-20.175-65200Lake(Lake 1999, Hoopes 1972)(Bjornn and Reiser 1991, Woll et al. 2017, Neuman and Newcombe 1977, Roberge et al. 2002)(Woll et al. 2017)",

    "text": "Theories of Change & Objectives\nTheories of Change are explicit assumptions around how the identified actions will achieve gains in connectivity and contribute towards reaching the goals of the plan. To develop Theories of Change, the planning team developed explicit assumptions for each strategy which helped to clarify the rationale used for undertaking actions and provided an opportunity for feedback on invalid assumptions or missing opportunities. The Theories of Change are results oriented and clearly define the expected outcome. The following theory of change models were developed by the WCRP planning team to “map” the causal (“if-then”) progression of assumptions of how the actions within a strategy work together to achieve project goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Theory of change developed by the planning team for the actions identified under Strategy 1: Crossing Remediation in the .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Theory of change developed by the planning team for the actions identified under Strategy 2: Lateral Barrier Remediation in .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Theory of change developed by the planning team for the actions identified under Strategy 3: Dam Remediation in .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Theory of change developed by the planning team for the actions identified under Strategy 4: Barrier Prevention in .",

The table below summarizes individuals, groups, or organizations that the planning team felt could lead or participate in the implementation of the plan and should be interpreted as the first step in on-going planning and engagement to develop more detailed and sophisticated action plans for each entry in the table. The individuals, groups, and organizations listed under the “Lead(s)” or “Potential Participants” columns are those that provisionally expressed interest in participating in one of those roles or were suggested by the planning team for further engagement (denoted in bold), for those that are not members of the planning team. The leads, participants, and estimated costs in the operational plan are not binding nor an official commitment of resources, but rather provide a roadmap for future coordination and engagement to work towards implementation of the WCRP.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Operational plan to support the implementation of strategies and actions to improve connectivity for target species in .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy / Actions\nLead(s)\nParticipants\n\n\n\n\n1.1 – Conduct habitat assessment above and below confirmed actionable barriers\nMSA\nMSA, CWF to support\n\n\n1.2 – Apply for permitting for actionable barriers with disconnected confirmed habitat\nMSA\nNSSA\n\n\n1.3– Rehabilitate Stream-Road Crossings\nMSA\nMSA, NSSA, CWF to support\n\n\n2 – Clear debris jams and identify opportunities to connect habitat without structure restoration\nMSA\n\n\n\n3– Knowledge gap: Look into thermal refugia and lateral barriers within the Margaree\nMSA\nCWF, ASF",

The Canadian Wildlife Federation and the planning team can coordinate proposal submission through these sources.\n\n\nFunding SourceSpending Restrictions and Other ConsiderationLand Based Investment StrategyAssessment and remediation of fish passage using provincial strategic approach. Primarily for remediation of Ministry-owned/orphaned barriers on forest service roads.Environmental Enhancement FundFish and wildlife passage improvements and restoration at stream and animal crossings at MOTI roads including culvert retrofits and replacement to restore Pacific salmon and trout access, and wildlife tunnels. Primarily for crossings linked to highway infrastructure.Community Salmon ProgramFor projects supporting the protection, conservation and enhancement or rehabilitation of Pacific salmonids and their habitat. Funding for volunteer and not-for-profit community-based groups. Applicant must have a significant volunteer component to their group and to the project. Requires 50% match for funding (volunteer, in-kind, donation or other grants). Southern Boundary Restoration and Enhancement FundSupports 3 activities: (1) develop improved information for resource management; (2) Rehabilitate and restore marine and freshwater habitat; and (3) enhance wild stock production through low technology techniques. Emphasis for funding is on stocks of conservation concern, particularly those contributing to a fishery and stocks of bilateral fishery relevance.Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation Enhancement and Restoration GrantsProjects that focus on freshwater wild fish, native wildlife species and their habitats, have the potential to achieve a significant conservation outcome, while maintaining or enhancing opportunities for fishing, hunting, trapping, wildlife viewing and associated outdoor recreational activities. Primary focus is on provincially managed fisheries such as Steelhead and Westslope Cutthroat Trout. Requires 50% funding match.Environmental Damages FundDirect funds received from fines, court orders and voluntary payments to priority projects that will benefit Canada’s natural environment, under 4 categories of improvement (in order of preference): (1) restoration, (2) environmental quality improvement, (3) research and development, and (4) education and awareness.Habitat Stewardship Program for Aquatic Species at RiskProgram for non-profits, Indigenous governments, academic institutions for activities that align with recovery actions identified in SARA recovery documents and/or COSEWIC assessment documents. Project must address one or more of 3 broad categories: (1) Important habitat for aquatic species at risk is improved and/or managed to meet their recovery needs; (2) Threats to aquatic species at risk and/or their habitat are stopped, removed, and/or mitigated; (3) Collaboration and partnerships support the conservation and recovery of aquatic species at risk. Limited to at-risk species listed under COSEWIC and/or SARA as threatened, endangered or special concern. Canada Nature Fund for Aquatic Species at RiskFunding program aimed at addressing priority threats for aquatic species at risk listed as endangered, threatened or Special Concern by COSEWIC, as they align with existing federal, provincial or other local recovery plans. Limited to species in the Columbia and Fraser basins in BC, among other priority areas across Canada. Focus on multi-year, multi-partner initiatives that apply an ecosystem or multi-species approach and create a legacy by enabling recovery actions that carry beyond the life of the funding program. Amounts from $100K-$1M available per year.BC Salmon Restoration and Innovation FundFunding for Indigenous enterprises, academia, industry associations, stewardship groups and commercial groups to support initiatives that support the protection and restoration of wild Pacific salmon and other BC fish stocks or ensure fish and seafood sector in BC is environmentally and economically sustainable. Five main priorities including species of concern rebuilding through habitat restoration with priority for projects that are part of a watershed-scale restoration plan/prioritization effort; build on successful previous restoration efforts; focus on critical habitat and/or the rehabilitation of natural ecosystem processes.Aboriginal Fund for Species at RiskProgram for Indigenous groups for activities that align with recovery actions identified in SARA recovery documents and/or COSEWIC assessment documents for species listed as Endangered, Threatened, or Special Concern by SARA or COSEWIC.
