    "text": "Purpose\nThe following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a collaborative planning effort, for the Margaree watershed, the overall aim of which is to build collaborative partnerships focusing on the health of the Margaree watershed to reduce the threat of aquatic barriers to migratory fish and the livelihoods that they support. This plan was developed to identify priority strategies that the Margaree River WCRP planning team (see Table 1) proposes to undertake between 2024-2035 to conserve and restore fish passage in the watershed, through crossing rehabilitation and barrier prevention strategies.\nWCRPs are long-term, actionable plans that blend local stakeholder and rightsholder knowledge with innovative geographical information systems (GIS) analyses to gain a shared understanding of where restoration efforts will have the greatest benefit for migratory fish. The planning process is inspired by the Conservation Standards (v.4.0), which is a conservation planning framework that allows planning teams to systematically identify, implement, and monitor strategies to apply the most effective solutions to high priority conservation problems. There is a rich history of fish and fish habitat conservation and restoration work in the Margaree watershed that this WCRP builds upon and aims to complement over the length of the plan. This includes work undertaken by the Margaree Salmon Association and work supported by the Nova Scotia Salmon Association (NSSA) and the Atlantic Salmon Federation (ASF). The planning team will aim to work with the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and other local stakeholders to promote coordination, decision-making, and implementation related to this plan.\nThe planning team compiled existing structure location and assessment data, habitat data, and previously identified priorities in the watershed, and combined this with local knowledge to create a strategic watershed-scale plan to improve freshwater connectivity. The Margaree River WCRP planning team applied the WCRP planning framework to define the “thematic” scope of freshwater connectivity and refine the “geographic” scope to identify the portions of the watershed where connectivity restoration efforts will take place. Additionally, the team selected focal species, assessed the current key habitat connectivity status of the watershed, defined concrete goals for gains in connectivity, undertook an iterative structure-ranking process to identify a list of priority barriers for rehabilitation to achieve those goals (see Table 2.1). Although the current version of this plan is based on the best-available information at the time of publishing, WCRPs are intended to be “living plans” that are updated regularly as new information becomes available, or if local priorities and contexts change. As such, this document should be interpreted as a current “snapshot” in time, and future iterations of this WCRP will build upon the results presented in this plan to continuously improve the practice of aquatic barrier rehabilitation for migratory fishes in the Margaree watershed. For more information on how WCRPs are developed, see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021).",

Naturally accessible waterbodies were spatially delineated for each species using stream characteristics that define the upper limit of their movement based on their swimming abilities (Table 1.1). The spatial extent of the naturally accessible waterbodies layer was then refined based on existing fish observation data and/or redd surveys (for Atlantic salmon). These maps were explored by the planning team to incorporate additional local knowledge, ensure accuracy, and finalize the criteria used to define naturally accessible waterbodies, which are shown for Atlantic salmon ({numref}fig2). The new geographic scope formed the foundation for all subsequent analyses and planning steps, including mapping and modelling key habitat, quantifying the current connectivity status, goal setting, and action planning, see Mazany-Wright et al.

    "text": "Focal Species\nFocal species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being conserved or restored in the watershed. In the Margaree watershed, the planning team selected Atlantic salmon as a primary focus with interest in incorporating American eel in future work. The selection of these focal species was driven primarily by the focal species of the primary funds supporting this planning work, the rich angling history of the Margaree, and the current threats to Atlantic salmon in the region.\n\nAtlantic Salmon\nAtlantic salmon are anadromous fishes, meaning mature adults spawn in freshwater and juveniles rear in freshwater before undergoing a process called smoltification where they migrate out to the ocean for 1-3+ years before returning to the freshwater to repeat this process. Due to this migratory process, salmon require unimpeded access between the ocean and freshwater habitats to complete their life cycle.\nAtlantic salmon spawn in the pool-riffle transition zones of the main stem and larger tributaries of a river {cite}deGaudemar2000; Finstad2010. Within these stretches, they seek out the tails of pools, where substrate size allows for females to excavate a space to deposit the eggs to incubate below gravel beds. Fast flowing, well oxygenated water with minimal fine sediments helps to maximize successful embryo development. Atlantic salmon juveniles (fry and parr) rear in habitat that is deeper and slower, to facilitate their weaker swimming and predation capabilities. Water depth, velocity, and substrate size tend to increase with parr as they increase in size and age. Shelter, in the form of large rocks, boulders, or overhead cover provide crucial refuge for overwintering habitat. Channel gradients most typically associated with these preferred spawning and rearing habitats range from 0.12 to 25%; with highest concentrations below 3% {cite}Amiro1993.\n\n\nAmerican Eel\nAmerican eel are catadromous species, meaning they spawn in the Sargasso Sea and drift with the ocean currents towards the continental shelf as glass eels. Elvers then continue migrating towards freshwater tributaries to feed and mature, although some populations have been known to stay in the estuaries and bays or move between freshwater and estuary habitat over their life cycle. Their ability to tolerate a wide variety of salinities and temperature thresholds allows them to occupy a variety of habitat types. See Appendix B for maps of modelled eel habitat in the seven northeastern watersheds.",

    "text": "Connectivity Modelling\nThe current connectivity status was estimated using three models:\nAccessibility model: Naturally accessible waterbodies are those that are considered likely accessible to focal species if no human-made barriers existed on the landscape. These were spatially delineated for each focal species using natural barriers (i.e., waterfalls, gradient barriers, or subsurface flows) that would limit upstream movement ({numref}Table1).\nHabitat model: A subset of the naturally accessible waterbody layer was defined as key habitat based on the KEA. The habitat model identifies waterbodies that have a higher potential to support key habitat based on stream characteristics like channel gradient and discharge. The habitat model criteria can be found in ({numref}Table 1).\nConnectivity model: A layer of known or modelled structures was overlaid on the key habitat results. Structures with unknown passability were treated as a full barrier until confirmed passable (100% passable) or partially passable (25, 50, or 75%) by either local knowledge, desktop review, or field assessment. Watershed connectivity was estimated by calculating the amount of key habitat that is connected to the ocean (i.e., not fragmented by human-made barriers). The amount of key habitat considered connected was determined by the cumulative passability of all downstream barriers. Key habitat with only passable structures downstream was considered fully connected. All key habitat with any full barrier downstream was considered disconnected. Connected key habitat upstream of partial barriers was weighted based on the passability values of any downstream partial barriers. For example, a 10 km habitat patch with two downstream partial barriers (both with 50% passability) was considered to represent 2.5 km of connected key habitat. All connected habitats were summed and divided by the total amount of key habitat in the watershed to determine the proportion of connected habitat relative to the entire watershed.\nA primary outcome of the WCRP is addressing barriers to restore connectivity within the Margaree River watershed. To achieve the goals set out in this plan it is necessary to identify a series of barriers that if made passable would reconnect a large contribution of Atlantic salmon and American eel habitat.\nAfter all existing data and knowledge are collated for known and modelled crossings, an iterative ranking process is conducted to help confirm barriers to target for rehabilitation to meet the goals. The ranking process is primarily used to guide field assessments and maximize efficiency in ground truthing data/knowledge inputs and model outputs, while providing a secondary purpose to evaluate the relative key habitat gains of confirmed barriers in the watershed. Field assessments can include an assessment of either the passability status of a structure (whether fish can pass upstream, and to what degree), whether the upstream habitat is suitable for the focal species, and whether there are other undocumented anthropogenic or natural barriers upstream or downstream. First, structures are grouped into ‘sets’. Sets are identified by maximizing the key habitat gain for barriers in the same tributary system. If adding a structure to a set reduces the gain-per-barrier (i.e., the total habitat gain of the set divided by the number of barriers in the set), then it is excluded and will be considered part of another set. Each set is ranked by its potential to contribute to restoring the overall habitat connectivity. The higher a set is ranked, the more potential contribution it makes to restoring the overall habitat connectivity, therefore making the set a higher priority for field assessment. By assessing the passability status and upstream habitat of the top-ranked sets, we close knowledge gaps with the greatest influence on the overall connectivity model results.\nSets are ranked by a combination of two factors:\nAn overall ranking for each set was produced as a composite of the long-term and immediate potential gain ranks to prioritize sets that maximize long-term and immediate potential to improve key habitat connectivity in the watershed. All structures in the watershed (excluding those confirmed as passable) were ranked and a subset of those structures were selected for field assessment.",

This was measured by calculating and ranking sets by the amount of total upstream key habitat (i.e., ignoring any additional upstream sets). This ranking identifies sets that would have the greatest long-term potential gain in habitat connectivity once any subsequent upstream barriers are addressed.\nThe immediate potential impact that restoring connectivity at that structure could have on the overall connectivity status. This was measured by calculating the amount of functional upstream habitat (i.e., key habitat between that set and the next upstream set of structures). Sets were then ranked by functional upstream habitat amount in tiers, where sets with no downstream sets were ranked first, then sets with one downstream set, and so on. This ranking identifies sets that have the greatest immediate potential gain in habitat by prioritizing sets that don’t rely on rehabilitation of downstream or upstream sets to realize these gains.\n\n\n\nAssessments\nThe majority of crossing structures in the Margaree River watershed were stream crossings for roads and trails making them the most abundant structure type in the watershed. The Margaree River watershed is also home to heavy beaver activity which can impact the flow and behaviour of streams within the watershed. Rapid assessment and ground truthing was completed for many of the structures within the watershed with formal assessments completed at three sites.

    "text": "Glossary\n\nFreshwater connectivity:\nThe degree to which aquatic species can disperse and/or migrate freely through freshwater systems.\n\n\nLongitudinal connectivity:\nConnectivity of a stream along the upstream-downstream plane, including access to tributaries and spawning and rearing habitat. Longitudinal connectivity can be fragmented by physical barriers (e.g., anthropogenic, or natural structures) or by physiological limits of distribution for species (e.g., stream gradient, temperature, or flow requirements).\n\n\nLateral connectivity:\nConnectivity of a stream bed to adjacent riparian wetlands, floodplains, side-channels, or off-channel features, including access to rearing and overwintering habitat. Lateral connectivity can be fragmented by physical barriers, channelization, armoring of the stream bed, or artificial flow regulation.\n\n\nVertical connectivity:\nConnectivity of a stream bed to groundwater/hyporheic zone, including access to oxygen-rich water and temperature refugia. Vertical connectivity can be fragmented by water withdrawals and anthropogenically induced changes to the hydrological, thermal, and sediment regimes of the watershed.\n\n\nTemporal connectivity:\nConnectivity variability in any of the three spatial dimensions (longitudinal, lateral, vertical) based on changes in the natural flow regime over time. Variation in the temporal connectivity occurs naturally; however, fragmentation can be exacerbated through anthropogenically induced changes to the hydrological, thermal, and sediment regimes of the watershed.\n\n\nGeographic Scope:\nThe spatial bounds within which connectivity models are applied and fish-passage improvement efforts are focused. This area is refined after the accessibility model is developed to cover only streams that are naturally accessible to each focal species or guild (see naturally accessible streams below).\n\n\nFocal Species:\nThe ecologically and culturally important species (e.g., Chinook Salmon) for which habitat connectivity is being conserved and/or restored in the watershed.\n\n\nFocal Guild:\nTwo or more focal species grouped together by shared characteristics (e.g., migratory behavior, swimming ability, and habitat use).\n\n\nKey Ecological Attribute (KEA):\nAn aspect of a focal species or guild’s biology or ecology that, if missing or altered, would lead to the loss of that focal species over time (e.g., proportion of connected spawning habitat).\n\n\nStructure:\nA feature, either anthropogenic (e.g., culvert, dam) or a temporary natural feature (e.g., barrier beach, debris jam) that may fragment freshwater systems and limit the ability of species to disperse and/or migrate freely within their naturally accessible habitat. Differentiated from more permanent natural features, such as waterfalls, that delineate naturally accessible waterbodies.\n\n\nSet of structures:\nA set of two or more structures that must be addressed/considered together for restoration or rehabilitation when considering the total amount of connectivity to be gained during barrier prioritization.\n\n\nPassability status:\nA categorization of how passable a structure is (unknown, partially passable, passable, impassable) to the focal species or guild. Note: this status may differ from a passability status defined in another database that reflects passability to non-focal species or uses other terms such as “potentially passable”.\n\n\nBarrier:\nA structure that has been assessed as impassable to the focal species for all life stages.\n\n\nPartial barrier:\nA structure that differs in passability status (impassable and passable) across life stages or through time (e.g., seasonally).\n\n\nPassable:\nA structure that is fully passable to the focal species for all life stages.\n\n\nUnknown:\nA structure for which passability by the focal species is unknown. These are typically structures that have not been assessed or have been assessed but require further assessment. These structures are considered barriers in connectivity models.\n\n\nModeled barrier:\nAll structures assessed as barriers and partial barriers, or with unknown status (either unassessed or assessed but needs more information is still needed) are treated as barriers in connectivity models.\n\n\nConfirmed barrier:\nAll barriers and partial barriers with confirmed key habitat upstream.\n\n\nDeferred barrier:\nPriority barrier for rehabilitation: The subset of confirmed barriers selected for proactive rehabilitation based on modelling outcomes. Remaining confirmed barriers may never be addressed or may be addressed at the end of their life cycle.\n\n\nNatural barrier:\nA permanent natural feature, such as a waterfall, stream reach with a steep gradient, or area of subsurface flow that focal species would not be able to pass. For diadromous species, all waterbodies upstream of such natural barriers are considered inaccessible. Resident species may have populations upstream and downstream of such barriers.\n\n\nStream network (also, hydrographic network):\nThe spatial representation of all waterbodies (streams, rivers, and lakes) in a watershed. The stream network is the foundation for all spatial modelling, and the accessibility and habitat models create subsets of the stream network.\n\n\nNaturally accessible waterbodies:\nThe portions of the stream network that are considered likely accessible to focal species or guilds if no anthropogenic barriers existed on the landscape. These are typically defined as all waterbodies downstream of natural barriers for diadromous species. For resident species, populations may persist upstream of a natural barrier; therefore, naturally inaccessible waterbodies are those upstream of a natural barrier where no observations of the focal species have been recorded.\n\n\nCurrent Connectivity Status:\nThe measure of important habitat (i.e., amount, proportion, or index) that is currently connected (i.e., unaffected by structures with a status of unknown, partially passable, or impassable) for each focal species and KEA. For non-diadromous species, indices such as the longest fragment or Dendridic Connectivity Index – potadromous (DCIp; Cote et al. 2009).\n\n\nConnectivity Goal:\nA SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) goal representing the desired future connectivity status of each focal species and KEA (e.g., a percent or total km of habitat) and the time by which it will be achieved (a target year).\n\n\nStructure Prioritization:\nAn analysis that ranks structures (individually and/or in sets) by the amount of key habitat disconnected by each individual structure. Structures are ranked in descending order according connectivity gains (e.g., greatest amount of linear km of important habitat) if restored or rehabilitated. This analysis includes structures with a passability status of “unknown”, “partially passable”, or “impassable”.\n\n\nRestoration:\nReturning the ecological structure and function (e.g., natural channel-forming processes) of a site to pre-disturbance conditions.\n\n\nRehabilitation:\nThe partial recovery of ecosystem function. This is typical when improving passage by replacing one type of crossing with another that is passable but may still affect the streambed or channel-forming processes.\n\n\nRehabilitated barriers:\nStructures for which connectivity for aquatic species was restored by altering or maintaining a structure that previously impeded movement.\n\n\nRemediation:\nA term for a form of restoration most often associated with mining, referring to the remediation of contaminated sediments. Often used as jargon in fish-passage discussions because it applies to both fish passage and barriers (i.e., both can be described as “remediated”). Most fish-passage projects involve ecological rehabilitation, but it is inaccurate to write that a barrier was rehabilitated. Instead, fish passage should be described as rehabilitated, improved, or restored (if appropriate), and barriers described as removed or addressed.\n\n\nExcluded structures:\nStructures that were investigated during a project but were removed from consideration or the model. Reasons for their exclusion could be that they do not exist, are passable, or no key habitat was found upstream.\n\n\nAssessed structures that remain data deficient:\nStructures that have had some form of assessment but need further investigation before a decision can be made to categorize them as either confirmed barriers, excluded structures (passable, non-existent, no suitable upstream habitat), or rehabilitated structures.",

To support a flexible prioritization framework to identify priority barriers in the watershed, two assumptions are made: 1,any modelled (i.e., passability status is unknown) or partial barriers are treated as complete barriers to passage and 2, the habitat modelling is binary, it does not assign any habitat quality values. As such, the current connectivity status will be refined over time as more data on habitat and barriers are collected. For more detail on how the connectivity status assessments were conducted, see Data Download and Methods.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: SAMPLE TABLE Connectivity status assessment for spawning and rearing habitat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Species\nKEA\nIndicator\nPoor\nFair\nGood\nVery Good\n\n\n\n\nAndromous Salmon\nAvailable Spawning Habitat\n% of total habitat\n&lt;50%\n51-75%\n76-90%\n&gt;90%\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Status:\n\n\n\n91",

    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment Methods\nThe connectivity status assessment for anadromous salmonids in the Margaree watershed builds on existing connectivity modelling work undertaken by the Canadian Wildlife Federation in partnership with the Atlantic Salmon Federation. The Margaree model within the NovaScotiaFishPass spatially locates known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identifies potential spawning and rearing habitat for focal species, and estimates the amount of habitat that is currently accessible to focal species within the Margaree. The model uses an adapted version of the Intrinsic Potential (IP) fish habitat modelling framework (see Sheer et al. (2009) for an overview of the IP framework). The habitat model uses two geomorphic characteristics of the stream network — channel gradient and mean annual discharge — to identify potential spawning habitat and rearing habitat for each focal species. The habitat model does not attempt to definitively map each habitat type nor estimate habitat quality, but rather identifies stream segments that have high potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for each species based on the geomorphic characteristics of the segment. For more details on the connectivity and habitat model structure and parameters, please see Mazany-Wright, N and Norris, S. M. and Lapointe, N. W. R. and Rebellato, B. (2021a). The variables and thresholds used to model potential spawning and rearing habitat for each focal species are summarized in Table 1. The quantity of modelled habitat for each species was aggregated for each habitat type and represents a linear measure of potential habitat.\nTable 1: Additional Key Actors. Key Actors are the individuals, groups, and/or organizations, outside of the planning team, with influence and relevant experience in the watershed, whose engagement will be critical for the successful implementation of this WCRP.\n\n\nSpeciesChannel Gradient (%)Mean annual discharge (m3/s)Channel gradient (%)Mean Annual discharge (m3/s)Minimum Lake area (ha)Multiplier (1.5x)Chinook Salmon0-30.46-322.50-50.28-100(Busch et al. 2011, Cooney and Holzer 2006)(Bjornn and Reiser 1991, Neuman and Newcombe 1977, Woll et al. 2017, Roberge et al. 2002, Raleigh and Miller 1986)(Woll et al. 2017, Porter et al. 2008)(Agrawal et al. 2005)Coho Salmon0-50.164-59.150-50.03-40Wetland(Roberge et al. 2002, Sloat et al. 2017)(Bjornn and Reiser 1991, Sloat et al. 2017, Neuman and Newcombe 1977, Woll et al. 2017, McMahon 1983)(Porter et al. 2008, Rosenfeld et al. 2000)(Agrawal et al. 2005, Burnett et al. 2007)Sockeye Salmon0-20.175-65200Lake(Lake 1999, Hoopes 1972)(Bjornn and Reiser 1991, Woll et al. 2017, Neuman and Newcombe 1977, Roberge et al. 2002)(Woll et al. 2017)",

The leads, participants, and estimated costs in the operational plan are not binding nor an official commitment of resources, but rather provide a roadmap for future coordination and engagement to work towards implementation of the WCRP.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Operational plan to support the implementation of strategies and actions to improve connectivity for target species in .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy / Actions\nLead(s)\nParticipants\n\n\n\n\n1.1 – Conduct habitat assessment above and below confirmed actionable barriers\nMSA\nMSA, CWF to support\n\n\n1.2 – Apply for permitting for actionable barriers with disconnected confirmed habitat\nMSA\nNSSA\n\n\n1.3– Rehabilitate Stream-Road Crossings\nMSA\nMSA, NSSA, CWF to support\n\n\n2 – Clear debris jams and identify opportunities to connect habitat without structure restoration\nMSA\n\n\n\n3– Knowledge gap: Look into thermal refugia and lateral barriers within the Margaree\nMSA\nCWF, ASF",
