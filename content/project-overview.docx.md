# Vision and Scope

## Purpose {-}

The following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a collaborative planning effort, for the Margaree watershed, the overall aim of which is to build collaborative partnerships focusing on the health of the Margaree watershed to reduce the threat of aquatic barriers to migratory fish and the livelihoods that they support. This plan was developed to identify priority strategies that the Margaree River WCRP planning team (see Table 1) proposes to undertake between 2024-2035 to conserve and restore fish passage in the watershed, through crossing rehabilitation and barrier prevention strategies. 

WCRPs are long-term, actionable plans that blend local stakeholder and rightsholder knowledge with innovative geographical information systems (GIS) analyses to gain a shared understanding of where restoration efforts will have the greatest benefit for migratory fish. The planning process is inspired by the Conservation Standards (v.4.0), which is a conservation planning framework that allows planning teams to systematically identify, implement, and monitor strategies to apply the most effective solutions to high priority conservation problems. There is a rich history of fish and fish habitat conservation and restoration work in the Margaree watershed that this WCRP builds upon and aims to complement over the length of the plan. This includes work undertaken by the Margaree Salmon Association and work supported by the Nova Scotia Salmon Association (NSSA) and the Atlantic Salmon Federation (ASF). The planning team will aim to work with the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and other local stakeholders to promote coordination, decision-making, and implementation related to this plan. 

The planning team compiled existing structure location and assessment data, habitat data, and previously identified priorities in the watershed, and combined this with local knowledge to create a strategic watershed-scale plan to improve freshwater connectivity. The Margaree River WCRP planning team applied the WCRP planning framework to define the “thematic” scope of freshwater connectivity and refine the “geographic” scope to identify the portions of the watershed where connectivity restoration efforts will take place. Additionally, the team selected focal species, assessed the current key habitat connectivity status of the watershed, defined concrete goals for gains in connectivity, undertook an iterative structure-ranking process to identify a list of priority barriers for rehabilitation to achieve those goals (see Table 2.1). Although the current version of this plan is based on the best-available information at the time of publishing, WCRPs are intended to be “living plans” that are updated regularly as new information becomes available, or if local priorities and contexts change. As such, this document should be interpreted as a current “snapshot” in time, and future iterations of this WCRP will build upon the results presented in this plan to continuously improve the practice of aquatic barrier rehabilitation for migratory fishes in the Margaree watershed. For more information on how WCRPs are developed, see @Mazany-Wright2021-hs.

## Vision {-}

Healthy, well-connected stream networks within the Margaree watershed support thriving populations of migratory fish. Both residents and visitors to the watershed work together to mitigate the negative effects of aquatic barriers, improving the resiliency of the stream network for the benefit and appreciation of all. 

## Scope {-}

![The primary geographic scope — the Margaree River watershed — located in the Fraser River system.](images/geo-scope-marg.png){#fig-geoscope}
The geographic scope of this WCRP was further refined by identifying naturally accessible waterbodies, which are defined as streams, lakes, or reservoirs that focal species would access in the absence of anthropogenic barriers.  Naturally accessible waterbodies were spatially delineated for each species using stream characteristics that define the upper limit of their movement based on their swimming abilities (@tbl-targspec).  The spatial extent of the naturally accessible waterbodies layer was then refined based on existing fish observation data and/or redd surveys (for Atlantic salmon).  These maps were explored by the planning team to incorporate additional local knowledge, ensure accuracy, and finalize the criteria used to define naturally accessible waterbodies, which are shown for Atlantic salmon ({numref}fig2).  The new geographic scope formed the foundation for all subsequent analyses and planning steps, including mapping and modelling key habitat, quantifying the current connectivity status, goal setting, and action planning, see @Mazany-Wright2021-hs.

## Focal Species {-}

Focal species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being conserved or restored in the watershed. In the Margaree watershed, the planning team selected Atlantic salmon as a primary focus with interest in incorporating American eel in future work. The selection of these focal species was driven primarily by the focal species of the primary funds supporting this planning work, the rich angling history of the Margaree, and the current threats to Atlantic salmon in the region. 

### Atlantic Salmon {-}

Atlantic salmon are anadromous fishes, meaning mature adults spawn in freshwater and juveniles rear in freshwater before undergoing a process called smoltification where they migrate out to the ocean for 1-3+ years before returning to the freshwater to repeat this process.  Due to this migratory process, salmon require unimpeded access between the ocean and freshwater habitats to complete their life cycle.

Atlantic salmon spawn in the pool-riffle transition zones of the main stem and larger tributaries of a river {cite}deGaudemar2000; Finstad2010.  Within these stretches, they seek out the tails of pools, where substrate size allows for females to excavate a space to deposit the eggs to incubate below gravel beds. Fast flowing, well oxygenated water with minimal fine sediments helps to maximize successful embryo development.  Atlantic salmon juveniles (fry and parr) rear in habitat that is deeper and slower, to facilitate their weaker swimming and predation capabilities.  Water depth, velocity, and substrate size tend to increase with parr as they increase in size and age.  Shelter, in the form of large rocks, boulders, or overhead cover provide crucial refuge for overwintering habitat.  Channel gradients most typically associated with these preferred spawning and rearing habitats range from 0.12 to 25%; with highest concentrations below 3% {cite}Amiro1993.

### American Eel {-}

American eel are catadromous species, meaning they spawn in the Sargasso Sea and drift with the ocean currents towards the continental shelf as glass eels.  Elvers then continue migrating towards freshwater tributaries to feed and mature, although some populations have been known to stay in the estuaries and bays or move between freshwater and estuary habitat over their life cycle.  Their ability to tolerate a wide variety of salinities and temperature thresholds allows them to occupy a variety of habitat types.  See Appendix B for maps of modelled eel habitat in the seven northeastern watersheds.

## Structure Types {-}

The following table highlights which barrier types pose the greatest threat to <species> in the watershed. The results of this assessment were used to inform the subsequent planning steps, as well as to identify knowledge gaps where there is little spatial data to inform the assessment for a specific barrier type. 


::: {#tbl-barriertype .cell tbl-cap='Structure types in the Margaree watershed and barrier rating assessment results. For each structure type listed \'extent\' refers to the proportion of key habitat for Atlantic salmon that is being blocked by that structure type, \'severity\' is the proportion of structures for each structure type that are known to block passage for Atlantic salmon based on field assessment, and ‘irreversibility’ is the degree to which the effects of a structure type can be reversed and connectivity restored. Key habitat for the purpose of this exercise is the total amount of spawning and rearing habitat represented within the Margaree watershed model.'}
