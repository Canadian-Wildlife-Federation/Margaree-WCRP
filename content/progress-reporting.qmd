# Progress Reporting

## Progress Summary {-}
Initial field assessments were completed in the Margaree watershed where 39 of the top ranked structures were visited for rapid assessment to determine whether the structures exist, if they were functionally passing fish, and if further assessment would be needed to determine fish passage status. Three debris jams were cleared during the 2025 field season restoring passage through three structures located on Gallant river, Mill Brook, and an Unnamed brook. Full assessments were done on 8 structures and a structure on MacSweens brook was identified as a high priority for restoration in 2026 in consultation with the NSSA. 

## Annual Progress Report {-}
The Margaree River Salmon Association (MSA) completed rapid and full barrier assessments at several sited throughout the Margaree watershed.  In depth habitat assessment and restoration planning are in progress and are planned to continue into the 2026 field season in partnership with the Nova Scotia Salmon Association.
